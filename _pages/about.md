I am a Ph.D. student in Theoretical Physics at the University of Milan. Here I work on the evaluation of Parton Distribution Functions (**PDF**) through
Neural Network techniques together with my supervisor Prof. Stefano Forte and the [NNPDF](https://nnpdf.mi.infn.it/){: .btn--research} collaboration.

Research Work
-------------
 
The main field in which I worked is the estimation and the inclusion of theory errors, in the context of **QFT** theory predictions, in a Neural Network fit. I also worked in the realization of a set of tools to automatize the computation of such theory predictions, the [Pineline](https://nnpdf.github.io/pineline){: .btn--research}. You can find more informations about my code projects in my Github Page [<i class="fab fa-fw fa-github" width="40" height="40"></i>](https://github.com/andreab1997 "Github page"){: .btn--icon}.

In the three years of my Ph.D. I also worked on several other projects, such as:
* Strong coupling precise evaluation with simulated data and theory errors.
* Consistency test for **Neural Network** applications (*closure tests*).
* Implementation of a more accurate scheme for Deep Inelastic Scattering (**DIS**) predictions, up to *N3LO*.


Detailed information about my reasearch work can be found in the list of my [publications](https://andreab1997.github.io/publications/ "publications"){: .btn--research} and in the list of my [talks](https://andreab1997.github.io/talks/ "talks"){: .btn--research}.

Teaching activity
-----------------

During my Ph.D. I was assistant professor for several bachelor and master courses. My teaching activity consisted mostly in exercises lessons and tutoring.

I also supervised three master thesis, all focused on the topic of
*explainable AI*. The main goal of these thesis was to obtain a more 
comprehensive understanding of the internal structure of a Neural Network through the design and the use of several diagnostic tools.
