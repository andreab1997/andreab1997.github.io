This is a simple (under-construction) set of pages speaking about me, my interests, my job and my life in general. 
On the top menu you can find [my publications](https://andreab1997.github.io/publications/ "my publications"), [my talks](https://andreab1997.github.io/talks/ "my talks"), [my teaching activity](https://andreab1997.github.io/teaching/ "my teaching activity") and [my CV](https://andreab1997.github.io/cv/ "my CV").
Have fun!
